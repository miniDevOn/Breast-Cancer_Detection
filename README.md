# Breast-Cancer_Detection
## Overview
This repository contains code for a Breast Cancer Detection model. The model is built using various machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn library. The goal is to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various features extracted from the tumor images.

## Features
- Utilizes scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms.
- Uses a combination of classification models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, Voting, and AdaBoost.
- Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

  Prepare the data:

## Ensure you have a properly formatted dataset of breast cancer tumor features.
- Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, scale features) as necessary.
 - Run the model:

  Open the breast_cancer_detection.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
  Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the breast cancer detection models.
  Experiment with different models and hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.
